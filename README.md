Welcome to Digitec Innovation. As part of our continuous evolution, we're seeking talented individuals like you to join our enterprise. This stage of the interview assesses your coding speed and knowledge.

## Task Overview

Your task is to develop a React application that displays a countdown timer to the launch of new merchandise for a Boutique Design Platform. This application should emulate the design shown in the provided "countdown-balenciaga.jpg" image.

### Requirements

1. Debug and Install the required packages (using Tailwind.css is a bonus)

2. Set a Target Date: Define a target date for the merchandise launch within App.js.

3. Pass Target Date to Component: Pass this target date as props to a Countdown.js component.

4. Countdown Calculation: Utilize a library to calculate and display the time remaining until the target date.

5. Loading Delay: Implement a 1-minute loading delay before the countdown page is rendered, which should be indicated by a loading spinner.

6. Design Implementation: Replicate the design as closely as possible based on "countdown-balenciaga.jpg", including the countdown timer and any additional elements shown in the image.

### Deliverables

Upon completion, your project should include the following:

* A functioning React application that meets the design and functional requirements.

* A Countdown.js component that receives the target date via props and displays the remaining time.

* An initial loading state featuring a spinner, which transitions to the countdown timer after a 1-minute delay.

* A user interface that matches the provided "countdown-balenciaga.jpg" design.


#### Good luck with your task.
